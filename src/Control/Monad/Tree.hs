Module      : Control.Monad.Tree
Description : Implementation of a non-deterministic tree monad.

This module contains the definition of a simple rose-tree-like datatype, parameterized by
 both the type of the labels for the branches, the type of elements contained
 in the leaves of the datatype, and the type @f@ of containers used for the branching: @Tree b f a@. 
 
Fixing the type of labels (usually @ b ~ () @ for simplicity), we have instances for
 Functor, Applicative, Monad, and Alternative. This is similar to the list monad, but because
 the underlying datastructure is a tree, and we can represent branchind non-determinism,
 there is more flexibility -- as when trying to extract data from a @Tree@, one can choose
 a search strategy for flattening the tree.
 
This module provides a simple breadth-first-search strategy @bfs@, and a depth-first
 strategy @dfs@, however, theoretically other strategies could be used, taking advantage
 of the information provided by the type of labels `b` for the tree. For instance, with
 @b ~ Double@, a best-first or probabilistic search could be used. This idea is implemented
 in @Control.Monad.Tree.Weighted@.
 
While these instances may be used directly to facilitate non-deterministic programming
 similarly to how the list monad is commonly used, this module also provides a simple
 EDSL for typed relational programming in Haskell. 
 
Values of types @Tree l (a,b,c)@ can be viewed as "tabular relations", where any of the arguments
 can be queried. This is facilitated by the @query@ function exposed by this module.
 
For values of type @Tree l Facts@ where @Facts@ is a sum type can also be viewed as general sets of
 facts that can be queried -- where the terms of @Facts@ can be viewed as particular typed relations.
 For instance:
 
 >
 > newtype Person = Person String
 >
 > data Facts =
 >    FriendOf Person Person
 >  | Father Person Person
 >  | Mother Person Person
 >  | Parent Person Person
 > 
 
This module also supplies various helper functions (applyRule, applyRuleL, and variants) to transform such sets of facts by applying prolog-style "rules" to derive further facts given a set of base facts.
